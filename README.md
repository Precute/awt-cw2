## Objective 2 by Huseyin Arpalikli
To implement my solution to the required merchandise store, I had researched the internet and found a suitable tutorial which guided me through created a web store using AngularJS. After using the tutorial, I have used AJAX to retrieve and send JSON data to and from the database to be used in the store. As well as this, I have implemented the checkout processing using Paypal and have have set up a Sandbox paypal account to test payments. I have implemented post variable that send to Paypal so that items are shown in the paypal checkout, which then can be paid for; following payment, the Instant Payment Notification handler will retrieve the paypal transaction data and store them into the local website database, where admin users can view orders and the paypal transactions. I have also created extra elements of the web app, where admin users can view orders and the paypal transaction data as well as including the ability to add new products by using AJAX and PHP.
The following scenario shows how the the store works:
1. User enters store, views products, etc; then adds products to the shopping cart;
2. User views their shopping cart and either completes checkout or clears basket;
3. When checkout via paypal is initiated the product data is sent via HTTP POST to paypal AND simultaneously creates a new order record in the DB;
4. User completes paypal payment and is redirected back to the store; the IPN handler begins pulling paypal transaction data which is then stored in a transaction database table;
5. Order data can be viewed by admin where they can see whether a payment has been successful or not. 

*This is the link to the tutorial I have used and can be looked at to see the vast differences between my work and the original tutorial (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/576246/A-Shopping-Cart-Application-Built-with-AngularJS)

## Built with 
-   AngularJS - front end web framework
-	Sublime text â€“ text editor
-	Github 
-	MySQLWorkBench -  connects to the database 
-	MAMP and Mudfoot - web server


## Test Cases
1.	View product data by clicking on a product; View products page, use product search (the search is not strict and can find matching terms from 2 characters)
2.  Add items to basket and edit quantity from basket; clear basket
3. 	Add items to basket and complete checkout using paypal sandbox user stated above; from admin user check order admin for the completed order and transaction (transaction can take a few mins to be added to database due to Paypal IPN delay)
4. Do same as 3 but cancel order before completing transaction, you should be taken back to the store with an empty basket but the orders will display the order as 'No Transaction Processed'.
5. View admin order area and use search to find specific orders and click on transaction id to view transaction data.
6. Add a new product in the admin area and check the product has been added to the database (therefore the store) (unsure, but might be an issue with image upload?)

The web app is currently connected to Ahmar's Mudfoot MySQL database as we felt it was easier to do it all via one database instead of mutiple.
