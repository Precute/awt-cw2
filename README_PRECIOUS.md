## Objective 3 by Osaretin Precious Igbinosun
## IRM and Robin’s Nest
IRM is a digital investment company and are the cuurent owner of Robin Nixon’s social networking site. They want to update the site wit more functionalities, security and a better user interface.  

## Overview for Objective 3 – Location Awareness API
This objective gives the uses the option to share location information with users and to track their location history too. Objective 3 uses HTML5 Google location API, geoPostion.js (HTML5 wrapper or framework) and IP-Based API to retrieve the location details to mark a user on a Google map. 

One of the main problem concerns for IRM was to map the location Awareness functionality adaptable for both existing users and current users.  With or with authorization, the IP-Base API displays user’s current location’s city and country. 

Its also supports older browsers up to Internet Explorer 5, mobile devices, non-GPS devices, Blackberry OS with or without internet connection.
